kurento single-player multiple-viewers
==============

This is an implementation of a video broadcasting application. There are two types of users in this application: 1 peer sending media (let's call it Presenter) and N peers receiving the media of the Presenter (let's call them Viewers). Thus, the Media Pipeline is composed by 1+N interconnected WebRtcEndpoints

This is a Sping-boot project
